While things are usually fun there's bound to be times when things go down the drain so please read through these rules and try to follow them as best you can. Breaking these rules can result in a mute, kick or even a ban depending on the severity of the violation.
   
Procyon Rules
 
1. Be respectful to each other and keep it civil. Do not make personal attacks or use excessive amounts of offensive language in addressing others. Where this line lies will differ per person, please respect each otherâ€™s boundaries.
 
2. Members should be at least 16 years of age. We are a mature community. No posting NSFW content. Exceptions exist just make sure to always, always spoiler tag it.
 
3. Dont use @everyone or @here pings. Use the appropriate @PvE and @PvP for when you are looking for someone in one of those categories for example.
 
4. Don't spam. This includes, but is not limited to: unnecessarily tagging any user or group, sending excessive amounts of messages or emoji at once or constant use of capital letters.
 
5. Cheese/Hacks/Exploits outside of raids that may hurt other players are prohibited. Inside raids it is up to the people who are playing with you, hive magic can make your life easy but make sure everyone is okay with it. If you are unsure about something ask the staff.

 
Please note that the above list of rules is not comprehensive. In addition to these rules, the moderation team reserves the right to remove messages and users from the server that are damaging to the clan and/or community. Since this is the first page you are seeing, ignorance of the rules does not excuse breaking them. For questions, more info or clarifications on the rules reach out to @nietcool or a @Moderator.
